## What is this language?

UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a standardized visual modeling language used to create diagrams that represent software systems, processes, and architectures. It was developed by a consortium of software companies in the late 1990s as a way to unify existing modeling languages and promote consistency in software development.

UML provides a set of graphical notations and semantics for modeling software systems. It includes a variety of diagrams, such as class diagrams, use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, and state machine diagrams. These diagrams are used to describe different aspects of a software system, such as its structure, behavior, and interactions with external entities.
