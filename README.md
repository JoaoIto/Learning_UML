## What is this language?

UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a standardized visual modeling language used to create diagrams that represent software systems, processes, and architectures. It was developed by a consortium of software companies in the late 1990s as a way to unify existing modeling languages and promote consistency in software development.

UML provides a set of graphical notations and semantics for modeling software systems. It includes a variety of diagrams, such as class diagrams, use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, and state machine diagrams. These diagrams are used to describe different aspects of a software system, such as its structure, behavior, and interactions with external entities.


## For what...?

UML is widely used in software engineering for requirements gathering, design, and documentation. It helps software developers to communicate and visualize their ideas and designs, and to ensure that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the system being developed. UML is also used in other domains, such as business process modeling and system engineering.
